Erlang Style Guide
==================

Goal: smash http://www.erlang.se/doc/programming_rules.shtml and
http://www.gar1t.com/blog/2012/06/10/solving-embarrassingly-obvious-problems-in-erlang/
together and see what happens.

Possible topics:

* Code style (indentation, short functions, avoid if/case, etc)
* Commenting style (including edoc)
* Data structures
* Common reasons to use ETS, DETS, Mnesia
* Communications patterns
* Processes for state management
* OTP patterns
* Other common Erlang patterns
* Bit syntax
* Patterns for leveraging NIFs, ports

Goal isn't to write yet another Erlang book, although something like
the O'Reilly cookbooks may not a terrible idea.
